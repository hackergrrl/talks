# state of the map 2017

1. mapping with the internet

2. mapping WITHOUT the internet

3. an open question

4. participate!

5. Q & maybe A

---

# why openstreetmap?

1. not bound to centralized authority

2. open data, open protocol

3. extensible data format

4. many quality clients already exist

5. big friendly community that share many of our values

---

# how do you make maps together without the internet?

let's review the traditional osm architecture!

# OSM.org architecture

# what if I'm offline?

- offline === can't work

- some clients can deal with brief offlineness (JOSM)

- what about full-time offline users?

- what if we NEVER connect to a central server?

- how do people collaborate on maps exclusively offline?

---

# peer-to-peer [an]architecture

1. what if each device ran its own OSM server and database?

2. what if each device (peer) could communicate directly to other peers? (p2p)

- fragile

- historic values?

- offline collaboration?

- maintain a log of all data operations ever performed

- can only be appended to

- old data cannot be deleted or modified

# kappa architecture

- kappa arch: time travelers' data structure of choice

- used git? you already know kappa architecture

---

# kappa architecture

- materialized views are
  - inexpensive
  - incremental
  - disposable

- data becomes durable, cacheable

---

# kappa sync

1. figure out which log entries each peer is missing from the other
2. send them
3. each peer appends those entries to their local append-only log
4. re-materialize the application's views with the new data

---

# kappa sync

cat observation log!

# what if two peers choose the same ID?

- we entrust ourselves to the **dark gods of entropy**

- generate unique 64-bit IDs for elements

- low odds[1] of collision



[1] depending on how much data you have

---

# what about elements' VERSION?

- OSM + optimistic locking = :(

- osm-p2p + cryptographic hash = :D

- guaranteed[1] uniqueness

- data deduplication



[1] choose your hashing algorithm wisely

---

# in summary

1. OSM is great

2. no servers: all peers are equal

3. reuse existing OSM editors

4. model data as append-only logs (kappa archecture) for durability

5. unique IDs via entropy and crypto-hashes to prevent conflicts

# open question: forks

1. bob edits a river offline

2. alice edits a river offline

3. bob and alice sync

4. which river do they see?

- respect diversity of technical experience

- for now: "newest wins"

- what about large elements?

# open question: forks

- embrace ambiguous forking data!
