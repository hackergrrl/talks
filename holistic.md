these are some of my ideals

---

I try to measure by own work and trajectory by them

---

it's OK if you don't

---

but maybe you'll see something you like

or make you want to discuss with others

or go and do some of your own reading

---

and learn something new

    *BRILLIANT BADASS TECHNOLOGIST*

# words are important


words have power!


prescriptive: steps


holistic: full discretion

> - the difference between these two may not be anything new to some of you

> - but having concrete words for ideas is what makes the ideas powerful
> - these terms create a spectrum that technologies can be measured
>   against!

> - suddenly we can express ideas more concisely than just "facebook is bad and
> - awful" and produce concrete measurements within a framework
>   - i.e. the societal effects of centralized software is more important than
>     facebook or any one technology by itself

> - prescriptive methods are great for consistently producing the same thing
>   over and over by means of discrete standardized steps (cars, enterprise
>   software, smartphones)

> - holistic methods tend to be preferred in contexts where full control over a
>   unique complex process is necessary (pieces of art, hacking on bleeding edge
>   tech & ideas /wo red tape constraint, and parenting)

# culture of compliance




                            technologies are NOT unbiased

> - franklin noticed that prescriptive tech has a tendency to create a "culture of compliance"

> - working consistently within a framework you are helpless to govern requires
>   you to become willing to accept such a limitation,

> - and it branches into other aspects of their life

> - suddenly we accept this helplessness and other prescriptive systems become
>   easier to swallow down

> - teaches people to be used to having little control

> - the dominance of these technologies discourages critical thinking

# web 2.0


   - tiny pocket computers

   - "free" storage of large amounts of data

   - cats

   - blocking ads

   - blocking blocking ads


> - how about mapping this onto the digital era?
> - surely there can't be anything more prescriptive than "the cloud"
> - though it also brought us superpowers that we didn't otherwise have
> - web 2.0 has undoubtedly changed the landscape of the web
>   - but these superpowers come at a societal cost
>   - BUT.. our programs don't work anymore without the cloud
> - we now rely on an external system controlled by forces that have corporate
>   profit as their primary priority
> - and can be subpoena'd at will by the government in some countries
> - mobile locked down OSes, the cloud, and the influence on the next generation
>   - children are growing up accepting the cloud and locked down mobile OSes
>   - this is going to influence their thinking about what technology IS
>   - this is HUGE

# social mortgage


prescriptive tech comes at a cost

> - when societies adopt technologies powered by these processes, they take on a

> - the cloud corporations silently took away our holistic tech (RSS, XMPP)

> - who know what RSS is?
> - who still uses it?

> - RSS is a pretty fantastic protocol
>   - ask a website "what's new" and get back a feed from it
>   - the feed is plain text; reasonably trivial to parse

>   - cloud storage
> - decidedly not holistic
>   - heck, I can't even send a push notification myself unless I pay Apple
>     $100/year and get their moral approval on my software
> - this is the "social mortgage":
>   - we traded convenience of not needing to worry about storing state or even
>     the need to request state in exchange for letting external sources decide
>     when & how to deliver content to us, and who's allowed to be included
> - now we're strongly dependent on the goodwill of these corporations
> - and their ability to remain in business
> - and their security practices to keep "our" data safe
> - all convenience comes at a cost
> - this enacted social change
>   - now it's become a user expectation to not need to ever ask for new data
>   - the "push" "revolution" ruined independent syndication
>   - so product makers are strong-armed into adopting these technologies
>   - and the technologies are controlled by gatekeepers
>   - developers without money or resources or platform buy-in are locked out
> - seems like a pretty high cost to me

# the unix philosophy


a methodology for building holistic tools & systems

# the unix philosophy


the power of the userland


political structure  ==>  code structure


the userland IS the workshop for holistic technology

> - the political structure around a piece of software's development tends to be

> - ASSERTION: the userland is the commons' green field for change
>
> - DEFINE userland: the place, in software or meatspace, where individuals have
>   full control over their working environment
>   - unix systems: everything on top of the kernel (we don't need root permissions to do things)
>     - the userland was open pastures: people could write their own tiny tools and
>       freely distribute them to others to use and share
>   - windows, osx: slightly higher up, with Microsoft's or Apple's policies in
>     between
>   - Android and iOS: virtually no userland (gatekeeper'd apps, a hidden
>     filesystem, and lack of common system tools makes these dangerously
>     prescriptive environments)
> - nodejs isn't dissimilar: a very small core but a rich userland with many
>   many thousands of modules on npm that can be used and modified
> - power is in the browser & the web, since any individual can push code and
>   store state
> - the userland IS the workshop for holistic technology!

# building a holistic toolchain


we need the browser


we need javascript


userland is wide when core is narrow


we need a philosophy

> - assertions:
>   - the revolution is going to have to happen on the web

>   - we're gonna need a highly empowering userland
>   - the power of the commons when the core is small and the userland is wide
>     open

>     core properties for granted
> - we need a philosophy
>   - the unix philosophy has served us well (doing one thing well since 1971)
>   - it applies cleanly to 2016 and our needs for a holistic, massively connected world:
