these are some of my ideals

---

I try to measure by own work and trajectory by them

---

it's OK if you don't

---

but maybe you'll see something you like

---

or make you want to discuss with others

---

or go and do some of your own reading

---

and learn something new

german-canadian, quaker, pacifist, feminist



    *BRILLIANT BADASS TECHNOLOGIST*

> - lots of interesting ideas on pacifism, feminism, war, and citizen politics

> - even more good ideas on technological society

> - I want to be clear that I'm summing up many of *her* big ideas here, and this

# prescriptive vs holistic



*prescriptive*                 <===[a spectrum]===>             *holistic*



 assembly lines                                                   artisans


 "the cloud"                                               personal garden


 renting an apartment                                          open source

> - a spectrum for measuring technology

>   - a bicycle

> - prescriptive: individuals are responsible only for a single step of the process
>   - each person on a car assembly line is responsible for one job

# bicycles and cars



*cars*                       <===[a spectrum]===>               *bicycles*


> - cars
>   - their construction require many humans in a large expensive process
>   - gas (its availability & price; has a whole market, governed by powerful entities)
>   - government license (you are tracked and appproved/disapproved by your gov't)
>   - policed
>   - roads (the greater powers govern where roads go and how easily places are to reach)
>   - insurance ($$$)
>   - purchase cost

> gosh, cars are actually a pretty oppressive technology!

# words are important


words have power!

> - the difference between these two may not be anything new to some of you

> - but having concrete words for ideas is what makes the ideas powerful and viral
> - because these two terms create a spectrum that technologies can be measured
>   against!

> - suddenly we can express ideas more concisely than just "facebook is bad and
> - awful" and produce concrete arguments within a framework
>   - i.e. the societal effects of centralized software is more important than
>     facebook or any one technology by itself

> - prescriptive methods are great for consistently producing the same thing
>   over and over by means of discrete standardized steps (cars, enterprise
>   software, smartphones)

> - holistic methods tend to be preferred in contexts where full control over a
>   unique complex process is necessary (pieces of art, parenting, hacking on
>   bleeding edge tech & ideas /wo red tape constraint)

# culture of compliance




                            technologies are NOT unbiased

> - franklin noticed that prescriptive tech has a tendency to create a "culture of compliance"

> - working consistently within a framework you are helpless to govern requires
>   people to accept such a limitation,

> - and it branches into other aspects of their life

> - suddenly we accept this helplessness and other prescriptive systems become
>   equally attractive

> - teaching people to be used to having little control

> - the dominance of prescriptive tech discourages critical thinking

# web 2.0


"the cloud"

> - how about mapping this onto the digital era?
> - surely there can't be anything more prescriptive than web 2.0 and "the cloud"
> - you might associate it with loss of control and the corporate-ization of the
>   web
> - but it also brought us superpowers that we didn't otherwise have
>   - tiny pocket computers
>   - free(TM) storage of large amounts of data
>   - cats
>   - blocking ads
>   - blocking blocking ads
> - web 2.0 has undoubtedly changed the landscape of the web
>   - our programs don't work without the internet
> - but these superpowers come at a societal cost
> - we now rely on an external system controlled by forces that have corporate
>   profit as their primary priority
> - and can be subpoena'd at will by the government in some countries
> - mobile OSes, the cloud, and the influence on the next generation

# social mortgage


prescriptive tech comes at a cost

> - when societies adopt technologies powered by these processes, they take on a
>   "social mortgage"; these techs come at cost
> - how the cloud corporations silently took away our holistic tech (RSS, XMPP)
> - the dream of the tech brings a cost to people, but once we accept it as a
>   society we have little hope of ever ending our enslavement to it
> - the cloud is an immensely powerful idea, but it comes /w a social mortgage
> - social mortgage: in exchange for the power of the cloud, we agree to
>   relinquish our control of our data -- for all values of "data"
> - but digital technology isn't the same as the industrial age: the cost of
>   entry is basically non-existant; collectively we have the same computation
>   power and storage as the cloud's data centres

# social mortgage


                                                                *RSS*

# social mortgage


*push notifications*           <===[a spectrum]===>             *RSS*

> - who know what RSS is?
> - who still uses it?
> - RSS is a pretty fantastic protocol
>   - ask a website "what's new" and get back a feed from it
>   - the feed is plain text; trivial to parse
>     - let's not hold XML against it
>   - you can download the articles and save them locally
> - RSS was huge in the 2000s
> - but something happened to displace it:
>   - social media
>   - mobiles & push notifications
>   - cloud storage
> - decided not holistic
>   - heck, I can't even send a push notification myself unless I pay Apple
>     $100/year and get their moral approval on my software
> - this is the "social mortgage":
>   - we traded convenience of not needing to worry about storing state or even
>     the need to request state in exchange for letting external sources decide
>     when & how to deliver content to us, and who's allowed to be included
> - now we're strongly dependent on the goodwill of these corporations
> - and their ability to remain in business
> - and their security practices to keep "our" data safe
> - all convenience comes at a cost
> - this enacted social change
>   - now it's become a user expectation to not need to ever ask for new data
>   - the "push" "revolution" ruined independent syndication
>   - so product makers are strong-armed into adopting these technologies
>   - and the technologies are controlled by gatekeepers
>   - developers without money or resources or platform buy-in are locked out
> - seems like a pretty high cost to me

# the unix philosophy


a methodology for building holistic tools & systems

> + DEFINE: what is unix?
>   - an operating system created in the 70s after the failed development of
>     Multics, a complex monolithic operating system from many of the same
>     developers, from the 60s
>   - they created something much smaller, more modular, and more extensible than
>     their first system -- a general philosophy and set of cultural ideas
>     calcified around that development; favouring composability rather than
>     monolithic design
> + unix philosophy
>   - major contributors are names like: Ken Thompson, Brian Kernighan, Dennis
>     Richie, Rob Pike, Doug McIlroy, Eric Raymond
>   - turns out this is also a manifesto for developing holistic programs
> + central axiom: do one thing and do it well
>   - "small, sharp tools"
>   - it's easier to unify a community around a single, unambiguous goal
>   - it's difficult for corporate forces to pervert something simple
>   - simple, not simplistic
> + rule of modularity / composition (make things work through simple interfaces)
>   - streams are generic and easily layered (encryption, etc on top)
>   - plaintext for applications where ever possible (for text is universal)
>   - binary over transports (TCP, UDP, websockets, UTP)
> + rule of separation (mechanism vs policy -- policy is ever-shifting)
>   - mechanism is the crux of how a thing works
>   - policy is the application of ever-shifting human preference
>     - authorization, authentication, resource allocation
>     - humans will always change their mind about these things
>   - this doesn't mean you should evade politics: data structures and designs
>     have baked-in politics, whether it's intentional or not
> + rule of simplicity / parsimony (simple things are harder to sneak malice into)
>   - the 100 line module is harder to sneak malice into than the 10,000 line
>     module

# the unix philosophy


the power of the userland

> - the political structure around a piece of software's development tends to be
>   reflected in the structure of its code
>
> - ASSERTION: the userland is the commons' green field for change
>
> - DEFINE userland: the place, in software or meatspace, where individuals have
>   full control over their working environment
>   - unix systems: everything on top of the kernel (we don't need root permissions to do things)
>     - the userland was open pastures: people could write their own tiny tools and
>       freely distribute them to others to use and share
>   - windows, osx: slightly higher up, with Microsoft's or Apple's policies in
>     between (we can do and run whatever we want, with a few caveats)
>   - Android and iOS: virtually no userland (gatekeeper'd apps, a hidden
>     filesystem, and lack of common system tools makes these entirely
>     prescriptive environments)
> - nodejs isn't dissimilar: a very small core but a rich userland with many many
>   thousands of modules on npm that can be used and version-pinned and modified
> - power is in the browser & the web, since any individual can push code to it
>   and store state in it
> - holistic tech is in the userland!
> - with the web we head into the brave future!

# building a holistic toolchain


for the future!

> - assertions:
>   - the revolution is going to have to happen on the web
>   - thus: javascript (and node!)
>     - with highly empowering userland (npm)
>   - the power of the commons when the core is small and the userland is wide
>     open
> - we need a philosophy
>   - the unix philosophy has served us well (doing one thing well since 1971)
>   - it applies cleanly to 2016 and our needs for a holistic, massively connected world:
>   - properties like: offline-first, transport-agnostic replication & routing
