# lightning talk: gitverse

- github is THE web platform for open source collaboration
  - but the software itself is closed
  - there's no way to contribute
  - have your voice heard
  - and no way to participate
  - this is called "software paternalism". microsoft is our authoritarian dad,
    and gets to tell us what we can and cannot do with the software they
    control, "permit" us to use, and NEVER own
  - but we're open source developers! we build things and share it generously
    and transparently! for FREE! this is a huge paradox!
  - so, a closed sol'n to open collaboration isn't the way forward; it doesn't
    capture our collective values
- what is a commons?
  - the world's air and water are commons
  - most of its land was a commons before private ownership
  - what is software was more like a commons?
  - mutually owned, no dictators, no corporate paternalism
  - we build it, we maintain it, we self-determine our destiny
- gitverse
  - a few of us are building something new to explore this
  - called gitverse
  - powered by decentralized tech like dat and secure-scuttlebutt
  - this is super fresh, but check out http://github.com/noffle/hypergit or come
    ask me about it
